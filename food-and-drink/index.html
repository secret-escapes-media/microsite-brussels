      <h2>Belgium definitely has a taste for extraordinary food</h2>
      <p>Best known for its beers, waffles, chocolate, speculoos and Brussels sprouts and cheese. The Kingdom of Belgium certainly has style and taste when it comes to culinary art and cuisine. Savour the regional cusine and gourmet traditions.</p>
      <p>The most exquisite dishes are masterfully concocted by real wizards, who also happen to be world-famous chef artists. There's more to the success of Belgian chefs than just mussels and chips, steak américain (raw minced meat) and café liégeois (cold dessert with coffee and ice-cream). What they have in common, besides their creativity, is the excellent quality of their products: fresh local produce combined with exceptional beers and soft cheeses.</p>
